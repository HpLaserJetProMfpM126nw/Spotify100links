# Spotify100links
A python script to convert more than 100 songs/links into multiple playlist such that each playlist has 100 songs/links
Ive tested this only on the Spotify desktop app.
Step 1- Select all the songs (using crtl + A) youd like to download and copy them.
Step 2- Paste all the links into a text file.
Step 3- Run the python script in the same folder as the text file and dont forget to add the name of the text file in the script
Step 4- Create multiple playlists by copy pasting from the output terminal.
Step 5- Download the playlist from some website like https://spotifydown.com/
